Here is the ER model for the bookstore database:

```
entity Bookstore [
    id (id),
    address (multi)
]

entity Book [
    isbn (id),
    name (multi)
]

relationship Sells {
    Bookstore : zero_many,
    Book : one_many
}
```

Explanation:

*   The `Bookstore` entity has an `id` attribute that is the primary key, and an `address` attribute that can have multiple values.
*   The `Book` entity has an `isbn` attribute that is the primary key, and a `name` attribute that can have multiple values.
*   The `Sells` relationship connects `Bookstore` and `Book` entities. A `Bookstore` can sell zero or many `Book`s, and a `Book` can be sold by one or many `Bookstore`s.
