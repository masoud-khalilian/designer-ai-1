We want to create the database for the consultation of historical books in a museum by some scholars.
To consult the books each person must register at the museum and acquire a card. Persons are identified by the 
identification code of the card; you also know the name, surname, a telephone number, an e-mail address, and the
address of the facebook page (if available). 
The books available at the museum are characterized by the ISBN, the title and the list of co-authors
of the book. For each book the list of titles of the chapters of the book is also known. If the book
is part of a series, you also know the name of the series and the number that characterizes the book
within the series. Each author is identified by a unique code and characterized by the name, surname
and any eventual pseudonym used to write.
Each consultation of a book is characterized by the person who made it, the date on which it was made,
the required book, and the state of wear of the book when withdrawn by the person for consultation.
Consider that the same book can be consulted by at most one person on each day. Consider also that
the same person can consult several different books in the same day and can consult the same book
several times but on different dates.
